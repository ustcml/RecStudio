# This is a configuration file for all models, which could be regarded as an example of
# configuration file.

# All the configuration parameters are divided into four groups: data, model, train and eval.
#   - data: data group contains some parameters related to dataset construction. For example,
#           `fm_eval` controls whether a sample is one interaction or all interactions for one user
#           in evaluation.
#   - model: model group contains some parameters related to the model size (or model architechture).
#   - train: train group contains parameters for the training procedure, such as epochs, learning rate.
#   - eval: eval group contains parameters for the evaluation procedure (validation and test), such as
#           batch size.
